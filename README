Geo::Coder::Cache

I tried to use LWP::UserAgent::WithCache with Geo::Coder::Google
to cache the results of geocoding requests, but it's useless, because
Google Maps API returns the results with Expires which expires
immediately. Then I decided to write this module.

Geo::Coder::Cache is a Geo::Coder::* wrapper with local file cache
implemented by Cache::FileCache.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Cache::FileCache

And, you should at least install one of Geo::Coder::* to make it
really work. Currently it supports:

  Geo::Coder::Google
  Geo::Coder::Yahoo
